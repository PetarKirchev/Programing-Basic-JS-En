<!-- ### Free Programming Courses at SoftUni

SoftUni organizes **free programming courses for beginners**: online and on-site in a few locations. The purpose is to give a chance to **everyone interested** in programming and technologies to **try programming**, check if they are interested and if they would get seriously involved in software development. You can sign up for the free course in **programming basics** using the SoftUni application page: [https://softuni.org](https://softuni.org).

The free programming basics courses at SoftUni aim to introduce you to **the main programming structures** from the world of software development that you will be able to apply in any programming language. These include working with **data**, **variables**, and **expressions**, using **conditional statements**, constructing **loops** and defining and calling **functions**, and other techniques to build programming logic. The training is **extremely practical** - which means there is a **strong emphasis on exercise**, and you get the opportunity to apply your knowledge as you learn them.

This **programming textbook** accompanies free programming courses for beginners at SoftUni and serves as an additional learning aid to support the learning process. -->

## The SoftUni Interactive Classroom

SoftUni’s self-paced programs teach software developers worldwide in the innovative **Interactive Classroom** that combines **video lessons, coding sessions, examples, and exercises** in a single platform on the Web.

Using the **SoftUni Interactive Platform**, you **write, execute and test code directly into the browser** and your exercise solutions are automatically evaluated by the integrated **Judge system**. If you have difficulties with an assignment, you can **get assistance** in multiple ways: with automated hints and guidelines or through SoftUni’s **help center**. Try it now with a [**7-day free trial**](https://learn.softuni.org/catalog?utm_source=JavaScript&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=free+programming+books).

This is how the **SoftUni Interactive Classroom** looks like:

## The Automated Judge System

**The SoftUni Judge system** (https://judge.softuni.org) is an automated system on the Internet **that checks solutions to programming problems through a series of tests**. **Real-time** problem submission and verification: you send a solution and in seconds, get an evaluation. You earn points for each task depending on your answer. For a completely right one, you get the maximum points for the problem. With a partially correct solution, you receive a fraction of the points. And with a completely wrong answer, you get 0 points. This how the **SoftUni Judge** looks like:![](/assets/chapter-0-images/Judge-System-Exercise.PNG)

**All problem in this book are available for testing in the SoftUni Judge system** and we strongly recommend that you test them once you have decided to know if you are missing something and whether your solution is working properly, as required by the problem.

Note also some **features of the SoftUni Judge system**:
 - For each problem **the Judge system keeps the highest achieved result**. If you upload a solution with the wrong code or a weaker result than your previous one sent, the system won't take points away from you.
 - The output results of your program are **compared** by the system strictly with the expected result. Any **redundant symbol missing a comma or space** may result in 0 points of the relevant test. **The output** that the Judge system expects is **described in the condition of each problem** and **nothing more should be added to it**.

**Example**: If a number is required to be printed in the output (e.g. **`25`**), do not display descriptive messages such as **`The result is: 25`**, but print exactly what is required, i.e. only the number.

The SoftUni Judge system is **available at any time** from its website: [https://judge.softuni.org](https://judge.softuni.org).
 - Use of the system is **free of charge**.

We are convinced that after a few problems are sent, you **will like to receive instant feedback** on whether the solution you wrote is true, and the judge system will become your favorite assistant when learning to program.
