# Preface

"**Programming Basics with JavaScript**" is the official book that introduces readers to writing **programming code** at a beginner's level (basic coding skills), working with the **development environment** (IDE), using **variables** and data, **operators** and **expressions**, working with the **console** (reading input data and printing output), usage of **conditional statements** (**`if`**, **`if-else`**, **`switch-case`**), **loops** (**`for`**, **`while`**, **`do-while`**) and working with **functions** (declaring and calling functions, passing parameters, and returning values). The book uses **JavaScript** programming language and **Visual Studio Code** development environment. The covered training material provides basic preparation for a deeper study of programming and prepares readers for the entrance exam in SoftUni.

The book is also used as an unofficial **textbook for school-level programming courses in the high schools**, studying professions like "**Programmer**", "**Application Programmer**" and "**System Programmer**", as well as an additional teaching tool in the initial programming courses at the **secondary schools, mathematical and professional high schools.**, and specialty "informatics and IT".

## Who is This Book Intended for?

This book is suitable for **complete beginners in programming**, who want to try what programming is and learn the main constructions for writing programming code that is used in software development, regardless of programming languages and technologies used. The book provides a **solid basis** of practical skills that are used for further study in programming and software development.

<!-- to update -->
<!-- For anyone who hadn't passed **[the free course on Programming Basics at SoftUni](https://softuni.org)**, we specifically recommend signing up for it **completely free**, because one learns programming by doing it, not by reading it! During the course, you will get free access to lessons, explanations, and live or online demonstrations (such as video tutorials), **a lot of practice and code writing**, help with the task solutions after each topic, access to trainers, assistants, and mentors, as well as forums and discussion groups for any questions, access to a community of thousands of people who are new in programming, and any other help that a beginner might need.

The free course for beginners in SoftUni is suitable for **school students** (of age 10+), **university students** and **workers** having any other professions, who want to gain technical knowledge, check if programming is what they like to do and understand if they would like to evolve in the software development field.

**A new group starts each month**. The "Programming Basics" course at SoftUni is organized regularly using a few different programming languages as a basis. So, just check it out! The course is **free**, and you can quit any time you like. **Signing up** for free - live or online training is available via the **SoftUni application form**: https://softuni.org. -->

## Why Did We Choose The JavaScript Language?

For this book, we chose **JavaScript**, because it is a **modern** language for high-level programming and at the same time it is easy to learn and suitable for **beginners**. As a use **JavaScript** is **widespread**, with a well-developed ecosystem, numerous libraries, and technological frameworks, and therefore gives many **prospects** for development. **JavaScript** combines the paradigms of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming in a modern way with easy-to-use syntax. In the book, we'll use the **JavaScript language** and the **Visual Studio Code** development environment, which is available for free from Microsoft.

As we will explain later, **the programming language with which we start is not essential**, but we still need to use some programming language, and in this book, we have chosen **JavaScript**. You can find the principles and concepts explained here illustrated with other programming languages like C#, JavaScript, and Python [here](https://softuni.org/learn/resources/free-programming-books?utm_source=JavaScript&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=free+programming+books).

## Programming is Learned by a Lot of Writing, Not Reading!

If anyone thinks they're going to read a book and learn to program without writing a code and solve tasks hard, they're delusional. Programming is learned with **practice**, with writing code every day and solving hundreds, even thousands of tasks, seriously and with perseverance, for years.

You need to **solve a lot of problems**, to make mistakes, to fix them, search for solutions and information on the Internet, to try, to experiment, to find better solutions, get used to the code, syntax, programming language, development environment, error search and debugging of non-working code, task reasoning, algorithmic thinking, breaking down problems in steps and implementing every step, gaining experience and lifting your skills every day, because learning to write code is just **the first step towards the profession of a software engineer**. You have a lot to learn!

We advise the reader, as a minimum, **to try all the examples from the book**, to play with them, to change and test them. Even more important than the examples **are the exercises** because they develop the practical skills of the developer.

**Solve all the tasks in the book**, because programming is learned by practice! The tasks after each topic are carefully selected to cover in-depth the covered learning
material. The purpose of solving all tasks from all the topics covered is to give **complete writing skills to a program code** at the beginners level (as is the purpose of this book).
